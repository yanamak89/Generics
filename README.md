# Homework Tasks

## Task 1: Study Basic Concepts and Constructs

- **Objective:** Learn and understand the fundamental concepts and constructs covered in the lesson.
- **Topics to Cover:**
  - Classes and Objects
  - Methods and Properties
  - Interfaces
  - Generics
  - Indexers
  - Exception Handling

## Task 2: Create MyList Class

- **Objective:** Create a Console Application project using Visual Studio. Implement a class `MyList` to mimic basic functionalities of `List`.
- **Minimum Interface Requirements:**
  - Method `Add` for adding elements
  - Indexer for accessing elements by index
  - Readonly property `Count` for total number of elements

## Task 3: Implement Magic GiftBag Class

- **Objective:** Develop a Console Application project. Implement a typed class "Magic GiftBag" where gifts appear based on the creature type attempting to access it. Each creature type should receive only one gift per day.
- **Use Constraints:** Utilize a type-constrained interface with a property storing the creature type.

## Task 4: Create Extension Method

- **Objective:** Create another Console Application project. Implement a static extension method `GetArray(this MyList list)` for the `MyList` class developed in Task 2. Display the values of the array returned by the `GetArray()` method.

## Task 5: Research on MSDN

- **Objective:** Visit the MSDN website and search for descriptions related to each example covered in the lesson. Save links and provide brief descriptions for each:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Methods and Properties
  - Interfaces
  - Generics
  - Indexers
  - Exception Handling

Ensure to replace placeholders with actual links and descriptions based on your research findings. This README serves as a structured guide to completing the homework tasks effectively.
